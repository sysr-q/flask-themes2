Flask-Themes2 is a fork of Spirits, which is in turn a fork of Flask-Themes.

- `Flask-Themes2 <https://github.com/plausibility/flask-themes2>`_ maintained by Christopher "plausibility" Carter
- `Spirits <https://github.com/drewlustro/spirits>`_ maintained by Drew Lustro
- `Flask-Themes <https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-themes>`_ by Matthew "LeafStorm" Frazier

This provides infrastructure for themes in Flask.

This was created as Flask-Themes doesn't support versions of \
Flask past 0.6 (or 0.7, I'm not 100% certain),
and as such, it has been no use since the last update \
(which was in 2011, would you believe!).

Installation
------------

To install normally:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install flask-themes2

To install the development (latest) version:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install -e git://github.com/plausibility/flask-themes2.git#egg=flask_themes2-dev
